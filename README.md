### 2. Properties
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `location`
  - `price_per_night`
  - `host_id` (Foreign Key → Users.id)

### 3. Bookings
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties.id)
  - `guest_id` (Foreign Key → Users.id)
  - `check_in_date`
  - `check_out_date`
  - `status` (e.g., pending, confirmed, cancelled)
- **Notes**: A booking belongs to one property and is created by one guest. A property can have many bookings over time.

### 4. Payments
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings.id)
  - `amount`
  - `payment_date`
  - `status` (e.g., successful, failed, refunded)
- **Notes**: Each payment is tied to a booking. A booking typically has one payment, but in some cases may have multiple (e.g., installments or refunds).

### 5. Reviews
- **Fields**:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `property_id` (Foreign Key → Properties.id)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key → Users.id)
  - `rating` (1–5 scale)
  - `comment`
  - `created_at`
- **Notes**: A user can leave multiple reviews, but only one review per booking/property combination is typically allowed. A property can have many reviews.

## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project includes several core features that replicate the essential functionality of a property rental platform. Each feature is designed to provide a seamless experience for both guests and hosts, ensuring usability, scalability, and reliability.

### 1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their accounts. Users can act as guests (booking properties) or hosts (listing properties), with role-specific functionality tailored to their needs.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and manage property listings. Each listing includes details such as title, description, location, pricing, and images, making it easy for guests to explore and compare options.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. The system ensures availability is accurately tracked, prevents double-booking, and provides hosts with booking requests and confirmations.

### 4. Payment Processing
The platform integrates a secure payment system that allows guests to pay for their bookings. It records transactions, supports different payment statuses (successful, pending, failed), and ensures financial transparency for both guests and hosts.

### 5. Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave feedback on properties they have stayed in, including a star rating and written comments. This feature helps build trust between users, provides valuable insights for future guests, and enables hosts to improve their services.

### 6. Search & Filtering
The platform includes a robust search and filtering system, enabling guests to find properties based on location, date, price range, amenities, and more. This ensures a smoother browsing experience and faster discovery of suitable properties.

### 7. Admin Dashboard (if included)
Administrators can monitor platform activity, manage users, handle disputes, and oversee property listings. This ensures the system remains secure, fair, and compliant with platform policies.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to maintaining trust, protecting user data, and ensuring the reliability of the Airbnb Clone platform. Since the system deals with sensitive information such as personal details, bookings, and payment records, robust security measures must be applied at every layer.

### 1. Authentication
- **What it is**: Authentication ensures that only verified users can access the system by requiring valid login credentials or tokens. Common methods include JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth2.  
- **Why it matters**: Protects against unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users can perform actions such as booking a property or managing a listing.

### 2. Authorization
- **What it is**: Authorization defines what a user can and cannot do after being authenticated. For example, a guest should not be able to edit another user’s property, while a host can manage only their own listings.  
- **Why it matters**: Prevents privilege escalation and enforces role-based access, ensuring that data and operations remain secure and properly restricted.

### 3. Data Encryption
- **What it is**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit (via HTTPS/SSL) and at rest (within the database).  
- **Why it matters**: Protects critical information such as user passwords, personal details, and payment records from being exposed in case of data breaches or interception.

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- **What it is**: Limits the number of API requests a client can make within a given timeframe.  
- **Why it matters**: Prevents abuse of the system, such as brute force login attempts or denial-of-service attacks, and ensures that resources remain available for legitimate users.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **What it is**: Validating and sanitizing user inputs before processing them in the system.  
- **Why it matters**: Protects against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious payloads that could compromise the backend.

### 6. Secure Payments Handling
- **What it is**: Integrating with trusted third-party payment providers and ensuring transactions follow security standards like PCI-DSS.  
- **Why it matters**: Protects financial data, ensures transaction integrity, and builds user trust in the platform’s ability to handle payments safely.

### Why API Security is Crucial
- **Protecting User Data**: Ensures sensitive personal information such as emails, addresses, and booking history remains confidential.  
- **Securing Payments**: Safeguards financial transactions and prevents fraud.  
- **Maintaining Platform Integrity**: Prevents malicious actors from exploiting the system, ensuring reliable and safe operations for all users.  
- **Building Trust**: Strong security practices help users feel confident using the platform, which is critical for adoption and growth.
